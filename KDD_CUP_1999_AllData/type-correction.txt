Note of Correction (June 26, 2007)

There was one typo in this data set.  It was in row 4817100 
in kddcup.data (and line 485798 in kddcup.data_10_percent):

0,tcp,private,S0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,00,tcp,http,SF,334,1684,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,0,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,normal.


Notice that part of another row was appended to this row 
(it probably was an accidental duplication of the row above).  
We have fixed the typo by removing the "partial row", so now
the row looks like this:

0,tcp,http,SF,334,1684,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.00,0.00,0.33,0,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,normal.

The correct data is now in kddcup.data.gz and kddcup-data_10_percent.gz.  

Many thanks to those who have notified us of this typo.
